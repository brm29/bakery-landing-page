## What I Worked On and Learned

This project was a great way for me to build my skills and practice web development. Here are some things I focused on and improved while making this site:

- Used a mobile-first approach for responsive design to make sure the site works well on all devices.
- Created flexible grid layouts with CSS Grid . 
- Added small hover effects to make the site better and look clean.  
- Used semantic HTML tags because they give the page clear meaning, make the structure easier to read. 
- Kept CSS clean, well-structured, and easy to update, making it simple to maintain and scale the design as needed.
- Made a contact form that checks inputs without using JavaScript.
